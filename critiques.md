# A1 Self & Partner Critiques
The self & partner critiques are an important exercise for your pair to reflect and provide feedback on both partner's contributions to the assignment (design, code implementation, reflections, collaboration, and effort). You should provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement your partner can make on future assignments in this course and beyond and/or commend them for their contributions and collaboration. It also an exercise for you to evaluate your own contributions & efforts in the assignment.

Before you submit the assignment, please discuss and review the partner critiques as a pair so both of you reach mutual understanding of what worked, what didn't, and how things can be improved. This is meant to be a constructive, reflective, and collaborative session.

The self critique & partner critique should take somewhere between 10-15 minutes to complete and the pair discussion & review of the partner critiques should be somewhere between 5-7 minutes. 

**If you worked individually, just fill out all the sections for *Partner 1* except the *Partner Critique* & *Authorship* sections.**
