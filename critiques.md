# A1 Self & Partner Critiques
The self & partner critiques are an important exercise for your pair to reflect and provide feedback on both partner's contributions to the assignment (design, code implementation, reflections, collaboration, and effort). You should provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement your partner can make on future assignments in this course and beyond and/or commend them for their contributions and collaboration. It also an exercise for you to evaluate your own contributions & efforts in the assignment.

Before you submit the assignment, please discuss and review the partner critiques as a pair so both of you reach mutual understanding of what worked, what didn't, and how things can be improved. This is meant to be a constructive, reflective, and collaborative session.

The self critique & partner critique should take somewhere between 10-15 minutes to complete and the pair discussion & review of the partner critiques should be somewhere between 5-7 minutes. 

**If you worked individually, just fill out all the sections for *Partner 1* except the *Partner Critique* & *Authorship* sections.**

## Self Critique (single paragraph)
**Please evaluate your contributions to the assignment. Critique your design, implementation, and effort.**

Sam and I did a lot of paired programming, so I would say much of the design was collaborative. Individually, I would say my design was strong and focused on modularity and avoidance of repitition in the code. Implementation was rough at first but made more sense as we did more paired programming together. I don't think there were any major lapses of effort on my end.

## Partner Critique (single paragraph)
**Please evaluate your partner's contributions to the assignment. Critique their design, implementation, collaboration, and effort, provide constructive suggestions for improvement, commend their contributions, etc.**

Sam did an amazing job handling the keys for much of our paired programming work. I was definitely the less skilled in javascript between the two of us, and Sam did an amazing job of taking charge and leading the initial development. Her design was generally very clean and I think we seamlessly fit our code together well. I think her effort was spectavular, and she did a TON of refactoring of our code to make it into a full closure, and did an amazing job at that. I think Sam definitely went above and beyond with this project, 10/10 partner.

# Partner 2 
## Info
**Name**:  Samantha York

**Email address (kerberos username or primary email if cross-reg)**:  samimak@mit.edu
## Reflection (Please provide just a few sentences)
**What did you learn from this assignment?**

I learned how to use closures in order to effectively prevent rep exposure and simulate private class fields.

**What was hard or easy?**

I think the main challenge was figuring out how to turn our board prototype into a closure, but once it got going it went well.
 
**How many hours did you spend on this assignment?**

5.0 hrs

**Any suggestions for how we might improve it?** 

Maybe provide a little bit better documentation on the functions that are passed into `init`? Once I figured out what they did it was really simple, but getting to that point was a little funky until I just tried using them.

**Any other feedback?**

Nope!

## Self Critique (single paragraph)
**Please evaluate your contributions to the assignment. Critique your design, implementation, and effort.**

I was a fan of the way that I refactored the board class into a closure, as it turned out to be a little bit more straightforward than I anticipated. I also like the ideas I had for some of the presets, as I think they turn into some pretty cool animations. Overall, I think I put solid effort into the assignment. I wish that I had suggested that we do it that way from the start, because then the refactor wouldn't have been necessary, but the learning experience was nice. I do wish that the overall implementation was a little bit cleaner, though, as I wasn't entirely sure what the best way to make the functions publically accessible was.

Ben was an amazing partner to work with, who put in a lot of effort to the project and came up with several of the ideas about the main functionality of the game (and the implementation of those). I really appreciated his input and catching of my mistakes. His code was very well documented and implemented, and it was super easy for me to follow/understand so I knew how to use it in my own code. We stayed in contact regularly throughout the assignment, and we were always on the same page, which definitely helped with this as well. Overall I am very glad that I had the chance to work with him, and honestly I don't know of much that he could do better - he was just great all around.
