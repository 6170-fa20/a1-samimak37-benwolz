# A1 Self & Partner Critiques
The self & partner critiques are an important exercise for your pair to reflect and provide feedback on both partner's contributions to the assignment (design, code implementation, reflections, collaboration, and effort). You should provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement your partner can make on future assignments in this course and beyond and/or commend them for their contributions and collaboration. It also an exercise for you to evaluate your own contributions & efforts in the assignment.

Before you submit the assignment, please discuss and review the partner critiques as a pair so both of you reach mutual understanding of what worked, what didn't, and how things can be improved. This is meant to be a constructive, reflective, and collaborative session.

The self critique & partner critique should take somewhere between 10-15 minutes to complete and the pair discussion & review of the partner critiques should be somewhere between 5-7 minutes. 

**If you worked individually, just fill out all the sections for *Partner 1* except the *Partner Critique* & *Authorship* sections.**

## Self Critique (single paragraph)
**Please evaluate your contributions to the assignment. Critique your design, implementation, and effort.**

Sam and I did a lot of paired programming, so I would say much of the design was collaborative. Individually, I would say my design was strong and focused on modularity and avoidance of repitition in the code. Implementation was rough at first but made more sense as we did more paired programming together. I don't think there were any major lapses of effort on my end.

## Partner Critique (single paragraph)
**Please evaluate your partner's contributions to the assignment. Critique their design, implementation, collaboration, and effort, provide constructive suggestions for improvement, commend their contributions, etc.**

Sam did an amazing job handling the keys for much of our paired programming work. I was definitely the less skilled in javascript between the two of us, and Sam did an amazing job of taking charge and leading the initial development. Her design was generally very clean and I think we seamlessly fit our code together well. I think her effort was spectavular, and she did a TON of refactoring of our code to make it into a full closure, and did an amazing job at that. I think Sam definitely went above and beyond with this project, 10/10 partner.

I did half. The design was nice, the implementation was cool, and the effort was maximal
