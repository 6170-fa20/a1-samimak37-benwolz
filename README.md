# A1: Game of Life

This repo has starter code for a browser implementation of John Conway's Game of Life in the browser with HTML, CSS, & Javascript.

The HTML and CSS portions as well as the JavaScript that interacts with the DOM are already written so you only need to implement the internal representation of the board state. 

Implement the functions in `internal.js` as specified.

Do not modify the code any code outside of `internal.js`.
